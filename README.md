# Bone-Histomorhometry

Bone histomorphometry allows quantitative evaluation of bone micro-architecture, bone formation, and bone remodeling by providing an insight to cellular changes. Histomorphometry plays an important role in monitoring changes in bone properties because of systemic skeletal diseases like osteoporosis and osteomalacia. Besides, quantitative evaluation plays an important role in fracture healing studies to explore the effect of biomaterial or drug treatment[1]. However, until today, to our knowledge, bone histomorphometry remain time-consuming and expensive. Information obtained from both static and dynamic histomorphometry provides a valuable profile of bone turnover as well as mineralization and bone quality, features that can comprehensively be assessed with reliability only from a biopsy[2]. Traditionally measurements performed with static and dynamic histomorphometry involve manual visual feature identification by trained professionals with creation of feature maps that are then quantitated by proprietary image analysis software programs (Osteomeasure™, Bioquant™). There is a high interoperability issue between pathologists drawing the feature maps. To overcome these drawbacks in manual process including the need for trained personnel engaging in a time-consuming process as well as potential subjectivity and both inter- and intra- operator variability we propose the development of an automated image analysis software based on a machine-learning algorithm that would create the feature maps for analysis.
